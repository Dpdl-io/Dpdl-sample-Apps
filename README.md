This repository contains some sample applications implemented with: **`Dpdl`** **(Dynamic Packet Definition Language)**

https://github.com/Dpdl-io/DpdlEngine

The purpose of the small applications listed here is to serve as demonstrators to show some features and language constructs of Dpdl.

Therefore the apps listed here are considered to be small prototype applications written with Dpdl.
