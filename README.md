This repository contains some sample applications implemented with: **`Dpdl`** **(Dynamic Packet Definition Language)**

https://github.com/Dpdl-io/DpdlEngine

The purpose of the small applications listed here is to serve as demonstrators to show some features and language constructs of Dpdl as well as to
prove the compliace to the techologies supported.

Therefore the apps listed here are considered to be small prototype applications written with Dpdl.

# Here some very <ins>Old</ins>, archived J2ME based projects developed using Dpdl

## Dynamic Skiing Location System (DSLS) - developed in year 2006

This mobile phone application have been developed by SEE Solutions in 2006, and was the sucessor of an earlier prototype application named MSLS (Mobile Skiiing Location System) developed in 2003.

The DSLS mobile application is a J2ME compiant navigation system for skiers that used Bluetooth(tm) technology to derive the skier's location, either via bluetooth gateways positioned at the lifts, or via and external bluetooth GPS receiver.

(DSLS running on Nokia 6600 mobile phone CDLC 2.0)

More info about DSLS can be found here: [Dynamic Skiing Location System DSLS.pdf](http://www.seesolutions.it/documents/Dynamic%20Skiing%20Location%20System%20DSLS.pdf)

Dpdl existed already as embedded scripting language and has been used in the project to handle blueooth connections, data and to perform dynamic drawings of the map canvas. The bluetooth client and bluetooth server was entirely developed with Dpdl.
