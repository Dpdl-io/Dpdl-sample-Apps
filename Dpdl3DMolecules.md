## Dpdl3DMolecule - a 3D visualization and animation app

**Dpdl source code:** 
[app/dpdl3dmolecule/dpdl3DJavaFX_molecule.h](https://github.com/Dpdl-io/Dpdl-sample-Apps/blob/main/app/dpdl3dmolecule/dpdl3DJavaFX_molecule.h)

The application has been ported to Dpdl from the JavaFX examples.

This Dpdl application makes use of the JavaFX library to create and animate a 3D visualization of a hydrogen chemical molecule.

The 3D model can be rotated freely with the mouse pointer
