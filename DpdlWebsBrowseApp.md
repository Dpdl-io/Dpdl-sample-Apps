Dpdl source code folder:
[app/dpdlwebsbrowseapp](https://github.com/Dpdl-io/Dpdl-sample-Apps/tree/main/app/dpdlwebsbrowseapp)

This Dpdl applications implements a fully compliant http embedded web-server which is capable of serving web content from a defined local directory via HTTP protocol. 

Due to the fact that the mongoose C network library is compiled in memory at runtime by the Dpdl runtime (very fast compile time), this application is completely cross platform.

The applications provides also a browser like User Interface (UI) to navigate the hosted web-sites. The browser supports most content creation technologies available in modern browsers (Html5, css, Javascript).


As example web-site a dashboard (from Mongoose) for controlling IoT devices via MQTT protocol is presented.
